# Sahayak – AI Assistant for Multi-Grade Classrooms

Sahayak is a mobile-first, AI-powered teaching assistant designed to support teachers in rural, low-resource Indian schools where a small number of educators are responsible for teaching multiple grade levels simultaneously. Using powerful tools like Gemini, Vertex AI, and Firebase, Sahayak reduces the teaching burden, enhances lesson delivery, and supports student growth — even offline and in local languages.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In many rural parts of India, there are only a few teachers available to manage the education of students from multiple grades — often all in the same classroom or across adjacent spaces. These teachers must simultaneously handle different subjects, age groups, learning levels, and classroom needs, with minimal time, digital infrastructure, or support. They struggle with lesson planning, personalized teaching, student assessments, and the creation of grade-appropriate materials — all of which limits both student learning outcomes and teacher effectiveness.

Sahayak solves this by acting as a versatile, multilingual AI assistant that helps teachers prepare hyper-local content, auto-generate grade-specific worksheets and assignments, assess students through voice or image inputs, track progress, and offer emotional check-ins — all tailored to multi-grade, rural learning environments.
